# Image-Duplicate-Manipulater
this is me trying sdl2  and it was hard lol

# Compile And Run
cd to the dir\
run\
\>make\
then run\
\>./TestSDL2

# Control
Scroll -> repeat horizontal and vertical\
Scroll + Q -> repeat vertical\
Scroll + W -> repeat horizontal

OpenGL isn't neccesary when using SDL2, I modified the code so that it doesn't use it\
thank you Gwitr
